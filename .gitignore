# .tfstate files (remote state is best practice)
# If you use remote state (e.g., S3, Azure Storage Account), these local files won't be created/used.
*.tfstate

# Optional: ignore tfstate backup files if they are somehow created outside the .terraform/ directory
# *.tfstate.backup

# Crash log files
crash.log
crash.*.log

# Exclude all .tfvars files, which may contain sensitive data
# You should manage different environments using other mechanisms (e.g., CI/CD variables) or use a secrets manager (like HashiCorp Vault).
# If you have non-sensitive variables in a specific file you want to commit, you can add an exception.
# Example: # !terraform.tfvars (to include a specific file if you are sure it contains no secrets)
*.tfvars

# Ignore CLI configuration files
.terraformrc
terraform.rc

# Optional: ignore graph output files
*.dot

# Optional: ignore plan files saved with `terraform plan -out=tfplan`
# *tfplan*
